# Research Repository

Welcome to my research repository!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Edinburgh.
I am on the Job Market for 2024-2025!
My research interests include behavioural economics, game theory, adaptive learning, searching and matching. I am particularly interested in the impact of bounded rationality or imperfect cognition on the matching market.
I am also interested in the applications of Large Language Models in economic games.
